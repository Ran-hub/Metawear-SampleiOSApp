Metawear-SampleiOSApp
========================

Sample iOS App for MetaWear (www.mbientlab.com)

## ATTENTION!
We use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) for dependency management, this means you need to open **MetaWearApiTest.xcworkspace** and not MetaWearApiTest.xcodeproj.

**Also, you must compile for a real device and not the iOS simulator**

## Getting Started

If you are new to MetaWear please check out our [getting started guide](https://mbientlab.com/gettingstarted).
